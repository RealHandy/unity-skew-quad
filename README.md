# Unity Skew Quad

A simple Unity package that enables creation of a skewed quad in Unity without a affine texture mapping.

Based on [Bitlush's work in OpenGL ES 2.0](https://github.com/bitlush/android-arbitrary-quadrilaterals-in-opengl-es-2-0)

## Setup

Load up the Demo scene to see how to set it up. The orthographic camera was simply a personal preference and is not necessary. 

Currently the SkewDemo calls UpdateMeshAndTexture in the Update loop but this is just for easy testing.

## Output

![Affine](Images/affine.png?raw=true "Affine Texture Mapping")
![Corrected](Images/correct.png?raw=true "Corrected Texture Mapping")
